[insert link to code and example for the impatient]

I know I know. “jQuery? That’s sooo 2013…” But actually, there are lots of reasons why you might want to use jQuery over other frameworks. Here are some of mine:

* You don’t want to use React/Vue/Angular because it’s overkill for what you want to do
* You don’t want to render your interface using JavaScript
* You want to use a jQuery based library/plugin
* You’re not the only front-end dev in your team and everyone has to study the framework if you want to use one

Not to say that you shouldn’t use React/Vue/Angular; I use React all the time. But I recognize that it doesn’t fit all the use-cases. So for the basic stuff, I stick to jQuery.

## On with it then
So first thing’s first, let’s start with the assumptions.

* You’re using ES6
* You’re using Webpack/Browserify or something similar to compile your JS
* You’re using npm based libraries

If you’re not familiar with the technologies I just listed, then I suggest you first read up on modern JavaScript. It might be painful at first, but trust me it’s totally worth it. Modern JavaScript is _really_ good. It’s what allowed me to write maintainable jQuery code with little fuss. Here are a few resources to get you started. [INSERT LINK TO RESOURCES HERE]

## Think Components™️
It’s generally a good idea to think of your interface in terms of components.

[Illustration of components here. Probably an illustration, not a screenshot]

For this blog post, I’m going to define a component as a **user interface element that only cares about itself**. Any code you write should only affect the component’s internals, and the component should be able to function independently. The only way for a component to affect and be affected by externalities is through event handlers and public methods.

## Enough about theory. Let’s write some code.

We’re going to build a carousel! Basic stuff. We have some arrows that navigate the slides. Also we have those dot things.

_Sidenote: We won’t focus on building out the styles for this. This blog post is all about the JavaScript._

Experience tells me that we can split this up into four components.

1. CarouselSlider - the sliding bit
2. CarouselDots - the dots on the bottom
3. CarouselControls - the left and right arrows
4. CarouselBlock - ties the previous three components up and orchestrates interactions between them

We'll put each component in its own js file.

> Sometimes components are simpler and don’t need to be broken down further, but I wanted to show a fairly complex example.  

### The HTML
We’ll start by writing the markup because it’ll be hard to write styles and JS without it. Here’s the markup I came up with.

```html
<div class="carousel-block">
  <div class="carousel-slider">
    <ul class="carousel-slider__slide-list">
      <li class="carousel-slider__slide">
        <img src="https://placehold.it/1280x800?text=1" alt="Horse 1">
      </li>
      <!-- More slides here -->
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="carousel-controls">
    <button class="carousel-controls__button carousel-controls__prev">◀</button>
    <button class="carousel-controls__button carousel-controls__next">▶</button>
  </div>

  <div class="carousel-dots">
    <button class="carousel-dots__dot carousel-dots__dot--active"></button>
    <button class="carousel-dots__dot"></button>
    <!-- More dots here -->
  </div>
</div>
```

The markup has four parts, `carousel-slider`, `carousel-controls`, `carousel-dots`, and the main wrapper `carousel-block`. These elements represent our four components.

The styles aren’t really relevant to what we’re building so I’ll omit them from the post. The only thing worth mentioning is the `carousel-dots__dot--active` class controls the dot’s active state.

### CarouselSlider.js
This component is responsible for rendering the slides themselves. Let’s take a look at the source code.

```javascript
import $ from 'jquery'

class CarouselSlider {
  constructor({root}) {
    // Select HTML nodes
    this.root = $(root)
    this.slides = this.root.find('.carousel-slider__slide')
    this.slideList = this.root.children('.carousel-slider__slide-list')
  }

  get slideCount() {
    return this.slides.length
  }

  slideTo(index) {
    // The transform property controls the position of the slider
    this.slideList.css({transform: `translateX(-${100 * index}%)`});
  }
}

export default CarouselSlider
```

There’s quite a bit going on here so let’s go through the interesting bits.

```javascript
import $ from 'jquery'
```

That’s right. No global jQuery. We install it via npm and import it in our code.

```javascript
class CarouselSlider {
  constructor({root}) {
    this.root = $(root)
```

Here we define a `CarouselSlider` class which takes a `root` parameter in its constructor. `root` serves as the top-level element of this component. Accepting the root element in the constructor makes it easier to reuse the component because it allows us to create more than a single instance of this component, linked to different HTML nodes.

```javascript
    this.slideList = this.root.children('.carousel-slider__slide-list')
    this.slides = this.slideList.children('.carousel-slider__slide')
  }
```

Here we’re selecting the root’s child components, the `slideList` and all the `slide`s

```javascript
  get slideCount() {
    return this.slides.length
  }
```

A getter that returns the number of slides present in the carousel.

```javascript
  slideTo(index) {
    this.slideList.css({transform: `translateX(-${100 * index}%)`});
  }
```

A method that flips the carousel to the slide on the given `index`. In this example, I implemented the slider using transforms.

Let’s look at how we can use the `CarouselSlider` class.

```javascript
const slider = new CarouselSlider({root: '.carousel-slider'})
console.log(slider.slideCount) // Prints out the number of slides
console.log(slider.slideTo(1)) // Slides to the second slide
```

Awesome right? We wrote all that code so that we can control the slider without having to call any low-level jQuery methods.

## CarouselDots.js
Here’s the code for the dots.

```javascript
import $ from 'jquery'
import EventEmitter from 'eventemitter3'

class CarouselDots extends EventEmitter {
  constructor({root}) {
    super()
    this.root = $(root)
    this.dots = this.root.children('.carousel-dots__dot')

    // Bind events
    this.dots.on('click', ev => this._handleClick(ev))
  }

  _handleClick(ev) {
    ev.preventDefault()
    const index = this.dots.index(ev.target)
    this.highlightDot(index)

    // Fire the clickdot event
    this.emit('clickdot', index)
  }

  highlightDot(index) {
    this.dots.removeClass('carousel-dots__dot--active')
    this.dots.eq(index).addClass('carousel-dots__dot--active')
  }
}

export default CarouselDots
```

We’re doing something special in this component. We want to be able to click on a dot and for the slider to slide to that dot’s slide.

We’re used to being able to use the `on` method with jQuery objects to listen to click/change/etc. events, but did you know that we can also fire our own custom events? That’s what `EventEmitter` is for. We extend `CarouselDots` from `EventEmitter` so that we can attach event listeners to the `CarouselDots` instance.

Here’s how that’s used:

```javascript
const dots = new CarouselDots({root: '.carousel-dots'})
dots.on('clickdot', index => console.log(`Clicked dot ${index}`))
```

We set the `clickdot` event to be fired in the `_handleClick` method. `_handleClick` is called when one of our dots is clicked. We figure out which dot triggered the event, and emit the `clickdot` event with `this.emit('clickdot', index)`. All the listeners will then be called, passing in the `index`. Events is the glue that ties all our components together.

There’s another method on `CarouselDots` called `highlightDot`. It does what it says on the tin: you pass in an index and it’ll highlight that dot.

## CarouselControls.js
```javascript
import $ from 'jquery'
import EventEmitter from 'eventemitter3'

class CarouselControls extends EventEmitter {
  constructor({root}) {
    super()
    this.root = $(root)
    this.buttons = this.root.children('.carousel-controls__button')

    this.buttons.on('click', ev => this._handleClick(ev))
  }

  _handleClick(ev) {
    ev.preventDefault()

    const target = $(ev.target)

    // Fire clicknext or clickprev, depending on which button was clicked
    if (target.hasClass('carousel-controls__next')) {
      this.emit('clicknext')
    } else {
      this.emit('clickprev')
    }
  }
}

export default CarouselControls
```

Again we’re using `EventEmitter` for this component. This time, we’re firing the `clicknext` or `clickprev` events when the left or right buttons are clicked. Unlike the previous component, we don’t pass any data along with our event.

```javascript
const controls = new CarouselControls({root: '.carousel-controls'})
controls.on('clicknext', () => console.log('Next was clicked'))
controls.on('clickprev', () => console.log('Prev was clicked'))
```

## CarouselBlock.js
This is where it all comes together.

```javascript
import $ from 'jquery'

import CarouselControls from '../CarouselControls'
import CarouselDots from '../CarouselDots'
import CarouselSlider from '../CarouselSlider'
import mod from '../../../lib/mod' // custom modulo function

class CarouselBlock {
  constructor({root}) {
    this.root = $(root)

    // Instantiate sub-components
    this.slides = new CarouselSlider({
      root: this.root.children('.carousel-slider')[0]
    })
    this.controls = new CarouselControls({
      root: this.root.children('.carousel-controls')[0]
    })
    this.dots = new CarouselDots({
      root: this.root.children('.carousel-dots')[0]
    })

    this.currentIndex = 0

    this.controls.on('clicknext', () => this.nextSlide())
    this.controls.on('clickprev', () => this.prevSlide())
    this.dots.on('clickdot', index => this.slideTo(index))
  }

  slideTo(index) {
    this.slides.slideTo(index)
    this.dots.highlightDot(index)
    this.currentIndex = index
  }

  nextSlide() {
    // We use modulo here to keep index from going out of bounds.
    let nextIndex = mod(this.currentIndex + 1, this.slides.slideCount)
    this.slideTo(nextIndex)
  }

  prevSlide() {
    let prevIndex = mod(this.currentIndex - 1, this.slides.slideCount)
    this.slideTo(prevIndex)
  }
}

export default CarouselBlock
```

We create an instance of each of the sub-components in the constructor. We attach event listeners to `clicknext`, `clickprev`, and `clickdot` events, which when called will call the appropriate methods. We also keep track of the currently displayed slide with the `currentIndex` variable. This is our single source of truth for which slide is currently displayed.

We have three methods, `slideTo`, `nextSlide`, and `prevSlide`. 

* `slideTo` just takes an index and calls methods on `slider` and `dots` to update their state.
* `nextSlide` calculates what the next index should be (using the modulo operator) and calls `slideTo`
* ditto for `prevSlide`, except it calculates what the previous index should be.

As a bonus, we can also use these methods on the `CarouselBlock` instance.

```javascript
const carousel = new CarouselBlock({root: '.carousel-block'})
carousel.nextSlide()
carousel.prevSlide()
carousel.slideTo(0)
```

This will be useful if we want to incorporate additional complexity to the carousel, like adding a timer that scrolls the slide every X seconds or something.

Since we’re passing in `root` in the constructor, we can have multiple independent instances of `CarouselBlock`.

```javascript
const carousel1 = new CarouselBlock({root: '#carousel1'})
const carousel2 = new CarouselBlock({root: '#carousel2'})
```

## So that’s it
Hope you learned something new today.
