[TL;DR.](https://github.com/mixxorz/python)

PEP 8 does a very good job of being the definitive coding style guide for
Python. It details a lot of rules that steer programmers to write code that’s
easy to read. It’s a very handy reference to have.

However, as I’m sure you’re aware, it doesn’t cover all the bases. There are
often times when you have to go off-script. You’re forced to be creative and to
improvise to make sure that the code you write remains readable.

I wrote this style guide in the hopes that it will remove some of the cognitive
overhead associated with making code style decisions. The rules are very
opinionated, but very easy to follow, and it covers the most common edge cases
I’ve encountered.

I don’t claim that this will make your Python code beautiful. But I do believe
this will help you get a little bit of your sanity back. Both for your
colleague’s sake, and for future-you’s sake.

I put the style guide in its own [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mixxorz/python)
for easy referencing and updating. Check it out!
