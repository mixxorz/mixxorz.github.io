description: Me trying to improve my design competence

Last week I signed up for something called [Daily UI](http://dailyui.co/). It's a daily newsletter where they send you design elements to design, daily, for 100 days. The hope is that after 100 days of consistent designing, you'll get better at it. I thought it'd be a fun way to kill an hour every weekday, so I signed up.

Day 001's theme is Sign Up forms.

This is what I've got. I went with sort of a modern elegant look for this website. I don't think it's perfect. It needs more thought. Generally, a sign up form for the web brings more opportunities to further instill in the customer what they're getting if they sign up, or maybe _why_ they signed up. Adding friendly copy would help. Maybe illustrations. In any case, this is what I came up with in an hour.

I also found quite interesting to only design _one_ element for an entire website. I find that for every design element that I'll do for Daily UI, I'd have to come up with at least a partial idea of the brand of the website I'm building the element for.

Well, here's to getting better at design! üçª
