Oh hi.

I'm not a very good writer. This is my first foray into the world of blogging. I'm mostly going to be writing about things that interest me. That would mostly be code things and design things. Most of what I'm going to write probably isn't original. That's because I'm doing this for myself to grow. I'm treating this place as my public notebook where I write about things that I'm trying to learn. Things like Docker, Django, Python, Design, Testing, BDD, all that jazz.

So, I hope this won't be my last entry, and let's see what happens.

Yep.
