Recently I've been working on "Spacesuit", a developer environment bootstrap
script that can work for both OS X and Windows, similar to thoughtbot's
[laptop](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop) script. On a bout of inspiration,
I decided that I wanted the repo to have a header image. So here we are, my
kinda first, from scratch, piece of art.
